Bugsnag Notifier API
====================

The Bugsnag Notifier API can be used to notify Bugsnag of an error or
exception in web, mobile or desktop applications.
[Official notifiers](https://bugsnag.com/docs/notifiers) are available
for several languages and frameworks.

If there is no notifier available for the language or framework you are using,
then why not write one yourself? Email us at
[notifiers@bugsnag.com](mailto:notifiers@bugsnag.com) to let us know about
your new notifier, and we will make it available to other Bugsnag users. We
will even give you special Bugsnag perks to say thank you!

[Bugsnag](http://bugsnag.com) captures errors in real-time from your web,
mobile and desktop applications, helping you to understand and resolve them
as fast as possible. [Create a free account](http://bugsnag.com) to start
capturing exceptions from your applications.


API Overview
------------

Bugsnag provides a simple JSON based API to notify us of errors. Simply
POST the [JSON Payload](#json-payload) to [http://notify.bugsnag.com](http://notify.bugsnag.com)
and Bugsnag will process the error.

It is recommended you make it possible to post errors over HTTPS, in which case
you should POST to [https://notify.bugsnag.com](https://notify.bugsnag.com).

Make sure you set the HTTP `Content-Type` header to be `application/json`.


Response Codes
--------------

We use standard HTTP response codes to let you know if your JSON Payload was
processed sucessfully. For non-200 response codes, we will also include a JSON
response with details of any error that occurred. Bugsnag will send one of the
following response code:

-   **200 (OK)**

    The error validated and will be processed.

-   **400 (Bad Request)**

    The payload failed syntax validation and was not processed.

-   **401 (Unauthorized)**

    Indicates that the API Key was incorrect.

-   **413 (Request Too Large)**

    Indicates that the payload was too large to be processed.

-   **429 (Too Many Requests)**

    Indicates that the payload was not processed due to rate limiting.


JSON Payload
------------

Here is the JSON payload for a notice to Bugsnag that an error has occurred in
an application. All fields are required, unless otherwise stated.

```javascript
{
    // The API Key associated with the project. Informs Bugsnag which project
    // has generated this error.
    apiKey: "c9d60ae4c7e70c4b6c4ebd3e8056d2b8",

    // This object describes the notifier itself. These properties are used
    // within Bugsnag to track error rates from a notifier.
    notifier: {

        // The notifier name
        name: "Bugsnag Ruby",

        // The notifier's current version
        version: "1.0.11",

        // The URL associated with the notifier
        url: "https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-ruby"
    },

    // An array of error events that Bugsnag should be notified of. A notifier
    // can choose to group notices into an array to minimize network traffic, or
    // can notify Bugsnag each time an event occurs.
    events: [{

        // A unique identifier for a user affected by this event. This could be
        // any distinct identifier that makes sense for your application/platform.
        // This field is optional but highly recommended.
        userId: "snmaynard",

        // The version number of the application which generated the error.
        // (optional, default none)
        appVersion: "1.1.3",

        // The version number of the payload. If not set to 2+, Severity will
        // not be supported.
        // (optional, default none)
        payloadVersion: "2",

        // The severity of the error. This can be set to "error", "warning",
        // or "info".
        // (optional, default "error")
        payloadVersion: "2",

        // The operating system version of the client that the error was
        // generated on. (optional, default none)
        osVersion: "2.1.1",

        // The release stage that this error occurred in, for example
        // "development" or "production". This can be any string, but "production"
        // will be highlighted differently in bugsnag in the future, so please use
        // "production" appropriately.
        releaseStage: "production",

        // A string representing what was happening in the application at the
        // time of the error. This string could be used for grouping purposes,
        // depending on the event.
        // Usually this would represent the controller and action in a server
        // based project. It could represent the screen that the user was
        // interacting with in a client side project.
        // For example,
        //   * On Ruby on Rails the context could be controller#action
        //   * In Android, the context could be the top most Activity.
        //   * In iOS, the context could be the name of the top most UIViewController
        context: "auth/session#create",

        // All errors with the same groupingHash will be grouped together within
        // the bugsnag dashboard.
        // This gives a notifier more control as to how grouping should be performed.
        // We recommend including the errorClass of the exception in here so a different
        // class of error will be grouped separately.
        // (optional)
        groupingHash: "buggy_file.rb",

        // An array of exceptions that occurred during this event. Most of the
        // time there will only be one exception, but some languages support
        // "nested" or "caused by" exceptions. In this case, exceptions should
        // be unwrapped and added to the array one at a time. The first exception
        // raised should be first in this array.
        exceptions: [{

            // The class of error that occurred. This field is used to group the
            // errors together so should not contain any contextual information

Notifier Configuration
----------------------

When writing a notifier, you should consider providing methods to allow users
to configure how errors are sent to bugsnag.

On our official notifiers, we provide the following interfaces:

### Application Settings

Your Bugsnag notifier should allow users to set the following settings in
their application.

-   **apiKey**

    The apiKey for the project, this **must** be provided by the developer.
    You should send this value in the [JSON Payload](#json-payload).

-   **releaseStage**

    The current release stage for the application. Most platforms have a
    sensible automatic way of obtaining this, for example `RAILS_ENV`
    in rails apps, and this should be used if possible.
    You should send this value in the [JSON Payload](#json-payload).

-   **notifyReleaseStages**

    A list of release stages that the notifier will capture and send errors
    for. If the current release stage is not in this list, errors should not
    be sent to Bugsnag. This should default to notifying for the "production"
    release stage only.

-   **autoNotify**

    If this is true, the plugin should notify Bugsnag of any uncaught
    exceptions (if possible). This should default to true.

-   **useSSL**

    If this is true, the plugin should notify Bugsnag using SSL.
    This should default to false.


### Per-Session Settings

You should also allow developers to set the following settings on a *per-request*
or *per-session* basis. These settings allow us to attach meta-data to each
error:

-   **userId**

    An ID representing the current application's user. Many platforms have a
    way to automatically fill this, for example `session` data in rails apps.
    You could also generate a UUID and store this on the user's device or in
    their session. Even if you automatically choose a userId, you should
    still allow developers to set one themselves.
    You should send this value in the [JSON Payload](#json-payload).

-   **context**

    Allow the developer to set the context that is currently active in the
    application. You should default this to something sensible for the
    platform, for example "action#controller" in a rails app.
    You should send this value in the [JSON Payload](#json-payload).

-   **extraData**

    Allow the developer to set any extra data that will be sent as meta-data
    along with every error. You should send this value inside `metaData`
    in the [JSON Payload](#json-payload).
