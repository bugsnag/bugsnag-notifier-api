Bugsnag Notifier API
====================

The Bugsnag Notifier API can be used to notify Bugsnag of an error or
exception in web, mobile or desktop applications.
[Official notifiers](https://bugsnag.com/docs/notifiers) are available
for many languages and frameworks.

If there is no notifier available for the language or framework you are using,
then why not write one yourself? Email us at
[notifiers@bugsnag.com](mailto:notifiers@bugsnag.com) to let us know about
your new notifier, and we will make it available to other Bugsnag users. We
will even give you special Bugsnag perks to say thank you!

[Bugsnag](http://bugsnag.com) captures errors in real-time from your web,
mobile and desktop applications, helping you to understand and resolve them
as fast as possible. [Create a free account](http://bugsnag.com) to start
capturing exceptions from your applications.
